# Codsoft Python Internship Tasks
This repository contains three mini Python projects developed during my Codsoft Internship.
Each project demonstrates essential Python programming concepts such as logic building, user interaction, and basic automation.

# Project Overview	
1. Simple Calculator	
   A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.	
   - Takes user input
   - Supports 4 operations
   - Handles division by zero
   file:calculator.py

2.	Password Generator
    Generates strong random passwords using a mix of letters, digits, and symbols.
    - User-defined password length
    - Combines letters, numbers, and symbols
    - Uses Python’s random and string modules
    file: password_generator.py

3. To-Do List Application	
   A simple task management program that allows users to add, delete, and view daily tasks.
   - Add, delete, and view tasks
   - Stores task list temporarily
   - User-friendly text interface
   file: task1_to-do_list.py

# Technologies Used
Python 3.x
Random and String modules
