# Codsoft Python Internship Tasks
This repository contains three mini Python projects developed during my Codsoft Internship.
Each project demonstrates essential Python programming concepts such as logic building, user interaction, and basic automation.

# Project Overview	
1. Simple Calculator	
   A basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.	
   - Takes user input
   - Supports 4 operations
   - Handles division by zero

2.	Password Generator
    Generates strong random passwords using a mix of letters, digits, and symbols.
    - User-defined password length
    - Combines letters, numbers, and symbols
    - Uses Python’s random and string modules
    file: password_generator.py

3. To-Do List Application	
   A simple task management program that allows users to add, delete, and view daily tasks.
   - Add, delete, and view tasks
   - Stores task list temporarily
   - User-friendly text interface
   file: task1_to-do_list.py

4.  Rock-Paper-Scissors Application
    A fun Python game where the user plays against the computer by choosing rock, paper, or scissors.
    -User and computer make their choices
    -Determines the winner based on game rules
    -Optional score tracking for multiple rounds
    -User-friendly interface with play-again option
     file: task4_rock_paper_cissors.py

5.  Contact_Book Application
    A Python program to store and manage contact details such as name, phone number, email, and address.
    -Add, view, search, update, and delete contacts
    -Displays contact list with names and phone numbers
    -Search contacts by name or phone number
    -User-friendly text-based interface for easy use
    file: task5_contact_management.py
